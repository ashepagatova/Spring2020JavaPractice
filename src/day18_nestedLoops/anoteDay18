Topics: do-While loop
        while vs do-while
        nested loop
package name: day18_nestedLoops
warmup tasks:
    1. write a program that can divide two numbers. ( Assume that first number is greater than the second)
            NOTE: DO NOT USE division, multiplication, or module operators
    2. write a program that can return the factorial number of any given number
            Ex:
                input: 5
                output: 120
            because:
                5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2* 1 = 120

        while(8 < 6){
                sout("Hello");
        }
        if condition is false in while loop, the statement never gets executed
do-while loop: at least gets exected one time regardless of the condition
        do{
            statements;
        }while(Condition);
        statement gets executed one time if the condition is false

            1. executed the statements
            2. check the conditon
                if thge condition is true:
                    repearts the step 1
                if condition is false:
                    stops the execution of the loop
nested if: if statement contains another if
nested loop: loop is inside another loop
    for(int z = 0; z < 5; z++){
            for(int i= 1; i <= 5 ; i++){
                    sout(i);
            }
        }
        ==> 1,2,3,4,5
            1,2,3,4,5
            1,2,3,4,5
            1,2,3,4,5
            1,2,3,4,5
            outer loop repeats the inner loop
